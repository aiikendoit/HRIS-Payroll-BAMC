The Human Resource Information System (HRIS) + Payroll is a collaboration between departments of Human Resource, Accounting, and Information Technology Services in Adventist Medical Center-Bacolod as a new solution to their current system, which is done manually.

We designed the new system to centralize and streamline the Human Resource Management and Payroll system for more efficiency and to eliminate data redundancy. This translates to simplified training; synchronized, faster processing times; up-to-date information; faster Payroll processing; manageable maintenance; and the ability to scale up to meet future needs.
